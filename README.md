### Hi there! My name is **Adam** 👋

## About Me

I'm a **computer science student** at the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology (WEiTI), Warsaw University of Technology.  
I’m passionate about **mathematics**, **programming**, and **wildlife photography** – combining analytical thinking with creativity, from solving complex problems to capturing unique moments in nature.

## Projects & Goals

- **OpenGL simulations** ([Boids](https://github.com/AdamCofala/Boids-OpenGL), [N-body Problem](https://github.com/AdamCofala/N-body-problem), [custom Game of Life variants](https://github.com/AdamCofala/Game-of-Life)).
- Build useful tools in **Python** (e.g., weather-based photography assistant).
- Deepen my understanding of applied mathematics and algorithms.
- Graduate with top marks while building a strong programming portfolio.
